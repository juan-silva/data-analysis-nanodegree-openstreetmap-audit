    "**By: Juan Silva**\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we performed the tasks to aquire, audit, pre-process, import and analyze a data set from open street map.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following was accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Describe the set we are working with\n",
    "2. Initial exploreation of the data set \n",
    "3. Audit data set for areas of concern prior to import\n",
    "4. Devise strategies to fix the data based on our findings\n",
    "5. Import the data into MondoDB for analysis (fixing the issues along the way)\n",
    "6. Analyze the data to see where we could potentially have a better impact to contribute back to open street map\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report we highlight the problems found and how they were attacked. We also do an overview of the data and present suggestion for improving it."

    "## Problems Encountered in Data\n",
    "\n",
    "After some initial exploration the following problems were identified to be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Street names were abreviated (In English and In French). (i.e. \"St.\" instead of \"Street\" or \"Boul.\" instead of \"Boulevard\")\n",
    "2. Postal Codes presented some problems like Province codes being prepended or extra characters like commas and other introduced. (i.e. \"ON K1B 4V4\", \"K2C 0L5,\")\n",
    "3. In particular the 'Fee' tag of Parking amenities entries has a variety of values which made it inconsistent. (i.e. 'Yes', 'No', 'Customers only', 'interval', 'daily' etc..)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Street Names\n",
    "\n",
    "We first set a group of expected street term and then tred to find instances where the street does not follow the expected format. We used a regular expression to get the last word of the street and match against our expected list. Then we logged any entries not following the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some iterations working out issues with language to match first words as opposed to last ones in French street names, the following entries were identified:\n",
    "\n",
    "**English:** \"Ave\", \"Blvd\", \"Dr.\", \"Rd\"\n",
    "**French:** \"Boul.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues were addressed by creating a mapping dictionary that was used to replace appreviations in both languages with their corresponding full words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Postal Codes\n",
    "\n",
    "After having imported data into MongoDB, some further exploration revealed problems with postal codes.\n",
    "We used a regular expression to find any entries that didn't match the expected Canadian Postal Code pattern."

    "## Findings and Ideas for Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the analysis we can see that the focus is very much on parking and restaurants. This makes sense and is probably among the things people would look for the most in a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wanted to understand how these were being tracked and for that we identified all the tags for each on of those amenities. Then we analyzed how many values for some of those tags (of interest) were avilable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is clear that although there is some specific data avilable. A large number of entries come back with \"None\" as their value. Which means that it has not been defined yet for those entries. This indicates a clear area of opportunity to fill in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fill in those gaps we could envision different ways of doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach would be to leverage social media to ask people to contribute their knowledge about the amenities. Facebook apps with gamification involved could encourage people to browse some of the amenities and answer question where they know. This could be shared with friends to encourage others to contribute. This approach would have the benefit of leveraging the community knowledge aboutthe area. However, there could be problems with data input. Users could make mispellings, enter data in more than one way, or enter wrongful information. Some of these may be aliviated by providing as much as possible fixed groups of options like in drop down menus. It also poses the challenge of motivating people to actually participate and there is no guarantee of fulfilling all missing areas equally or by a specific timeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach could be web data mining leveraging other sources that have compiled this information already. For example sites like yelp.ca could be parsed/queried to try to extract some of the missing information for those amenities. This will have the advantage of having full control of how much data we retrieve and the formatting of such data. We could identify the issues in the source data and do some munging to fit it to our model. Still if the source does not provide an API to obtain the information, we could face a lot of challenges to extract the information by scrapping the pages. Furthermore if the owners of the sites decide to change the markup of the page, our scrappers need to be updated. Then there is the issue with being banned by the sites if they have policies against crawlers going through their content. \n",
    "\n",
    "I think the approach to be taken will depend on the needs of the project that we may be working on which requires the data set to be more complete. Depending of the specifics of the information missing, one or other approach would be the right one.\n",
